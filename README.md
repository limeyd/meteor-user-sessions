# User Sessions for Meteor

Attach users to [client-sessions](http://client-sessions.meteor.com)

[Check out the demo!](http://user-sessions.meteor.com/)

## Installation

First download it and add it to your Meteor packages

Now add it to your app

    meteor add user-sessions

## Usage

I'll add instructions eventually. Until then check out demo app in repo.

## TODO

Expose a handle to current user in Meteor methods (same way sessionId works). I mean that's the whole point right!

User model field validation

Lowercase email addresses

Fuzzy password option

Pass through options to client session

Figure out why username field isn't saving history, would nice if we could make it prompt to save password in browser.

Make it work without bootstrap
